In this project, bulk messages are sent via WhatsApp to numbers stored in a database(Here is name "numbers.txt"). The implementation of the project is done in a relatively amateur manner, utilizing the "Selenium" and "PyAutoGUI" libraries to carry out the operations. As the project is designed for personal needs, meticulous attention to detail has not been a primary concern.
